# Simple Guide to Neural Network Layer Types

## Dense/Fully Connected Layers
**What they do:** Connect every input to every output  
**Best for:** Final decisions, combining features  
**Think of it as:** "Consider everything at once"

## Convolutional Layers (Conv)
**What they do:** Look for local patterns using small filters that slide across input  
**Best for:** Images, finding edges/shapes/textures  
**Think of it as:** "Scanning with a magnifying glass"

## Pooling Layers
**What they do:** Shrink the data by taking max or average of small regions  
**Best for:** Reducing size while keeping important info  
**Think of it as:** "Zooming out to see the big picture"

## Activation Layers
**What they do:** Apply functions like ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh  
**Best for:** Adding non-linearity so networks can learn complex patterns  
**Think of it as:** "Deciding which signals to keep strong vs weak"

## Normalization Layers
**What they do:** Keep numbers in reasonable ranges between layers  
**Best for:** Making training stable and faster  
**Think of it as:** "Volume control for your signals"

## Dropout Layers
**What they do:** Randomly turn off some neurons during training  
**Best for:** Preventing overfitting  
**Think of it as:** "Training with some team members randomly absent"

## Recurrent Layers (RNN/LSTM/GRU)
**What they do:** Process sequences while remembering previous items  
**Best for:** Text, time series, anything with order  
**Think of it as:** "Reading while remembering what you just read"

## Embedding Layers
**What they do:** Convert words/categories into dense numerical vectors  
**Best for:** Handling categorical data like words  
**Think of it as:** "Giving each word a unique numerical fingerprint"

**The key:** Different layers solve different problems. Mix and match them like LEGO blocks to build networks for your specific task!
